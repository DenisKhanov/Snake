# Snake Game in Go

Welcome to the Snake Game written in Go! This repository contains the implementation of a classic Snake game using the Go programming language and SDL2 for graphics rendering. The game features a snake that grows as it eats food, avoids obstacles, and plays with simple controls.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake with the arrow keys to eat food and grow longer.
- **Game Instructions**: Easy-to-read game instructions displayed on the screen.
- **Responsive Design**: Resizes the game window based on system capabilities.
- **High Scores**: Tracks your score and displays it in real-time.
- **Game Over Mechanism**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Graphics**: Custom fonts and colorful visuals to enhance the user experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Go**: A Go runtime environment to compile and run the game.
- **SDL2**: Used for graphical rendering. The `SDL2.dll` and `libmcfgthread-1.dll` files are embedded in the project for Windows users, and will automatically be extracted when running the game.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
    cd snake-game
    ```

2. **Install Go dependencies**:
   If you're using Go modules, simply run:
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. **Run the game**:
   To run the game, execute the `main.go` file:
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## How to Play

- Use the **arrow keys** to control the direction of the snake.
- **Eat food** to grow the snake.
- The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the boundaries of the game area.
- Track your **score** and how many food items you've eaten on the right side of the screen.
- **Restart the game** after it ends by pressing any key.

## Key Functions and Features

### `Game` Struct
This is the core struct of the game which holds all the data and state information related to the game.
```go
type Game struct {
    cv         *canvas.Canvas
    wnd        *sdlcanvas.Window
    param      *GameParam
    snake      *Snake
    food       Point
    fonts      Fonts
    gameAreaSP Point
    gameAreaEP Point
    cellW      float64
    cellH      float64
    side       float64
    score      int
    ateFood    int
    gameOver   bool
    needMove   bool
}
```

### Movement Directions
The game uses the `Dir` type to handle the snake's movement. Directions are encoded using constants:
```go
const (
    up = iota
    right
    down
    left
)
```

### Game Controls
The user can control the snake using the arrow keys:
- **Up Arrow**: Move Up
- **Right Arrow**: Move Right
- **Down Arrow**: Move Down
- **Left Arrow**: Move Left

### Snake Logic
The `Snake` struct holds the segments of the snake and manages its movement. The snake's body is represented as a slice of `Point` structs, and its movement is handled by the `Exec` method:
```go
func (d Dir) Exec(point Point) Point {
    switch d {
    case up:
        return Point{point.X, point.Y + 1}
    case down:
        return Point{point.X, point.Y - 1}
    case left:
        return Point{point.X - 1, point.Y}
    case right:
        return Point{point.X + 1, point.Y}
    default:
        return point
    }
}
```

### Game Logic
- **Direction Check**: The snake cannot reverse direction. This is managed by the `CheckParallel` method:
```go
func (d Dir) CheckParallel(newDir Dir) bool {
    switch d {
    case up:
        return newDir == down
    case right:
        return newDir == left
    case down:
        return newDir == up
    case left:
        return newDir == right
    default:
        return false
    }
}
```

### Fonts and Rendering
Custom fonts are loaded for the game interface:
```go
func (g *Game) initFonts() {
    mainFont, err := g.cv.LoadFont(samuraiFont)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    instructionFont, err := g.cv.LoadFont(dejavuFont)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    easyFont, err := g.cv.LoadFont(righteousFont)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    fonts := Fonts{
        main:   mainFont,
        middle: instructionFont,
        small:  easyFont,
    }
    g.fonts = fonts
}
```

### Game Parameters
The `GameParam` struct defines the window and game area sizes:
```go
type GameParam struct {
    windowW int
    windowH int
    gameW   float64
    gameH   float64
    speed   int
}
```
